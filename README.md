Music genre classification

The idea is to have a chatbot which when conversed wwith would run entiment and emotion analysis to understand the mood of the user. 

Once the mood has been classified then we use audio analysis using ML to understand which music suits the person in a particular iteration

Once we have tracks in tow we cureate a playlist and play for the user through spotify. 

Prerequisites:
- Access to spotify credentials of the user
- user input for analysis
